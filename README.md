# Beers
**Beers** is a simple experimental app implemented using the new amazing **SwiftUI**.

The app shows a list of beers fetched from **Punk API** (https://punkapi.com) and displays a detail view on tap.

# Issues

Currently the beer image in the detail view is getting stretched and therefore looks ugly. I have to dive deeper into **SwiftUI** to understand and fix it.
